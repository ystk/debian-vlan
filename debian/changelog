vlan (1.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add XS-Vcs-Git and XS-Vcs-Browser fields to control.
  * Fix and cleanup the vlan-interfaces.5 man page.
  * Drop useless delta and cleanup Debian diff.
  * Rewrite copyright file completely; some copyrights and licensing headers
    are missing upstream and should be clarified with the help of upstream.
  * Stop installing README; no useful additional information.
  * Drop Debian specific exit codes for vconfig errors; use upstream exit
    codes instead; document this change in NEWS.
  * Big cleanup to build and rules; misc fixes for obsolete constructions.
  * Cleanup CCFLAGS:
    - Build without -D_GNU_SOURCE; makes no difference on the resulting
      binaries, so simply rely on the upstream build.
    - Build with -O2 unless DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS has noopt.
  * Prepare to ship macvlan_config in the future.
  * Add support for bonding in if-pre-up and if-post-down scripts; cleanup
    these scripts; closes: #404630.
  * Point to the vlan-interfaces(5) man page in the Debian README and
    recommend setting vlan-raw-device.
  * Add support for wlan in if-pre-up and if-post-down scripts;
    closes: #398837.
  * Document the bonding and wlan changes in NEWS.
  * Install howto.html as documentation.
  * Document that aliases are ignored by the vlan scripts; closes: #400827.
  * Add debian/TODO list.
  * Pass STRIP=true to the upstream build to avoid stripping; closes: #438253.
  * Hide "bind-type" in help string as it doesn't seem to be implemented;
    closes: #398807.
  * Document that the default for REORDER_HDR is 1 since 2.6.18; thanks
    Kristian SÃ¸rensen; closes: #436219.
