VLANs in /etc/network/interfaces
================================

Check the vlan-interfaces(5) man page and make sure you set vlan-raw-device in
your interfaces stanzas.  You can omit the hint in some cases, but it's best
to always have the keyword.


MAC-VLAN
========

You need a kernel with the MAC-VLAN driver to use macvlan_config.  MAC-VLAN
support was merged in the Linux kernel for version 2.6.23.


Aliases
=======

Interface aliases are completely ignored by the VLAN scripts; see
vlan-interfaces(5).
