vlan (1.9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Error codes of vconfig back in sync with vanilla vlan:  the vconfig
    command was incorrectly returning a zero exit status up to upstream
    release 1.9 of the vlan package.  Starting with Debian version 1.9-1, the
    Debian version of vconfig was modified to always return 1 on failure while
    the upstream version of vconfig would return different error codes
    depending on the actual error; these changes are now being dropped in
    favor of compatibility with upstream error codes.  See Debian #320452 for
    the original report on broken exit codes.

  * The if-pre-up.d and if-post-down.d vlan scripts now support bond and wlan
    devices like eth devices; make sure this doesn't conflict with your local
    setup.  The recommended way to set the underlying raw device is the
    vlan-raw-device keyword; see vlan-interfaces(5).
